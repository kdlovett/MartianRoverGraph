# MartianRoverGraph

Just a small personal project for learning purposes. Visually represents a six day span of Mars rover data to provide
insight into the rovers' trends over a short scale.

# Attribution:

Bucky Robert "thenewboston"'s Youtube tutorials were helpful for learning the basics behind tkinter.

Also found the eff-bot Python documentation on more minute aspects of tkinter quite helpful.

The json file is used to make the http request to the NASA api. (My brother showed me the best way
of going about that, by putting it in a separate file.)

Thanks!

Utilizes Nasa's open source "Mars Rover Photos" data.

# Good example test input:
Sol: 580, Rover: Curiosity, Camera: FHAZ
