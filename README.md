# MartianRoverGraph

Just a small personal project for learning purposes. Visually represents a six day span of Mars rover data to provide
insight into the rovers' trends over a short scale.

Bucky Robert "thenewboston"'s Youtube tutorials were helpful for learning the basics behind tkinter.
Also found the eff-bot Python documentation on more minute aspects of tkinter quite helpful.
Thanks!
Utilizes Nasa's open source "Mars Rover Photos" data.

Some good testing inputs:
Sol: 580, Rover: Curiosity, Camera: FHAZ
