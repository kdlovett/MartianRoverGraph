# MartianRoverGraph

Just a small personal project for learning purposes. Displays the number of photos taken by a given Mars rover camera on a given sol, and for the next few sols. Hopefully will display some further information about these images.

Utilizes Nasa's open source "Mars Rover Photos" data.

Some good testing inputs:

Sol: 580, Rover: Curiosity, Camera: FHAZ
